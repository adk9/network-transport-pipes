Network Transport Pipes Design Document:

- new Transport creates a "data" file
  - it also creates a background thread which polls this file for writes
- new Endpoint creates a new "chan"
  - receive Endpoint is simply a receive on the channel.
  - cannot send data on an Endpoint.
- new Connection (endpoint, endpoint address)
  - choose a conn id
  - send a control message to the remote process
  - control data needs to be communicated out-of-band
  - opens the file pointed to by the endpoint address.
